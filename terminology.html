        <h4>Electric Supply</h4>
        <p>The price charged by a supplier for the actual commodity.</p>
        <h4>Energy</h4>
        <p>The capacity for doing work as measured by the capability of doing work (potential energy) or the conversion of this capability to motion (kinetic energy). Energy has several forms, some of which are easily convertible and can be changed to another form useful for work. Most of the world's convertible energy comes from fossil fuels that are burned to produce heat that is then used as a transfer medium to mechanical or other means in order to accomplish tasks. Electrical energy is usually measured in kilowatthours, while heat energy is usually measured in British thermal units.</p>

        <h4>Generation Company</h4>
        <p>A regulated or non-regulated entity (depending upon the industry structure) that operates and maintains existing generating plants. The generation company may own the generation plants or interact with the short-term market on behalf of plant owners. In the context of restructuring the market for electricity, the generation company is sometimes used to describe a specialized &quot;marketer&quot; for the generating plants formerly owned by a vertically-integrated utility.</p>
        <h4>Gross Generation</h4>

        <h4>Independent System Operators</h4>
        <p>An independent, Federally-regulated entity that coordinates regional transmission in a non-discriminatory manner and ensures the safety and reliability of the electric system.</p>
        <h4>Industrial</h4>
        <p>The industrial sector is generally defined as manufacturing, construction, mining agriculture, fishing and forestry establishments Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 01-39. The utility may classify industrial service using the SIC codes, or based on demand or annual usage exceeding some specified limit. The limit may be set by the utility based on the rate schedule of the utility.</p>
        <h4>Intermediate Load (Electric System)</h4>
        <p>The range from base load to a point between base load and peak. This point may be the midpoint, a percent of the peakload, or the load over a specified time period.</p>
        <h4>Internal Combustion Plant</h4>
        <p>A plant in which the prime mover is an internal combustion engine. An internal combustion engine has one or more cylinders in which the process of combustion takes place, converting energy released from the rapid burning of a fuel-air mixture into mechanical energy. Diesel or gas-fired engines are the principal types used in electric plants. The plant is usually operated during periods of high demand for electricity.</p>
        <h4>Interruptible Gas</h4>
        <p>Gas sold to customers with a provision that permits curtailment or cessation of service at the discretion of the distributing company under certain circumstances, as specified in the service contract.</p>
        <h4>Interruptible Load</h4>
        <p>Refers to program activities that, in accordance with contractual arrangements, can interrupt consumer load at times of seasonal peak load by direct control of the utility system operator or by action of the consumer at the direct request of the system operator. It usually involves commercial and industrial consumers. In some instances the load reduction may be affected by direct action of the system operator (remote tripping) after notice to the consumer in accordance with contractual provisions. For example, loads that can be interrupted to fulfill planning or operation reserve requirements should be reported as Interruptible Load. Interruptible Load as defined here excludes Direct Load Control and Other Load Management. (Interruptible Load, as reported here, is synonymous with Interruptible Demand reported to the North American Electric Reliability Council on the voluntary Form EIA-411, &quot;Coordinated Regional Bulk Power Supply Program Report,&quot; with the exception that annual peakload effects are reported on the Form EIA-861 and seasonal (i.e., summer and winter) peakload effects are reported on the EIA-411).</p>
        <h4>Investor-Owned Utility</h4>
        <p>A class of utility whose stock is publicly traded and which is organized as a tax-paying business, usually financed by the sale of securities in the capital market. It is regulated and authorized to achieve an allowed rate of return.</p>

        <h4>Kilowatt (kW)</h4>
        <p>One thousand watts.</p>
        <h4>Kilowatthour (kWh)</h4>
        <p>One thousand watthours.</p>
        <a name="L" id="L"></a>
        <h4>Load (Electric)</h4>
        <p>The amount of electric power delivered or required at any specific point or points on a system. The requirement originates at the energy-consuming equipment of the consumers.</p>
        <h4>Local Utility Delivery Charges</h4>
        <p>Delivery charges cover the use of the delivery company's poles and wires, costs associated with reading the meter, public programs, transition charges, taxes and other costs of doing business experienced by the delivery company. These charges are typically passed through on the single bill option. These charges are consistent for customers regardless of their supply source (ComEd or a retail marketer).</p>
        <h4>Losses</h4>
        <p>As electricity moves through the network of poles and wires, energy is lost. The amount of electricity measured at the meter is less than originally produced at the generation facility. To account for this variance with any product that does not include losses, supply costs are multiplied by transmission and distribution loss factors to determine this cost component.</p>
        <h4>Current PJM Transmission Losses</h4>
        <p>Transmission Losses (assessed by PJM) are line losses incurred while transporting electricity from the generating station to the distribution system. Current transmission losses are 1.6% of metered volumes.</p>
        <h4>Current ComEd Distribution Losses</h4>
        <p>Distribution losses are line losses incurred while moving electricity along the distribution system to the customer's electric meter. Distribution Loss Factors are in ComEd's Rate RCDS tariff and range from 2.8% to 7.5% depending upon customer class. After 2006, these same distribution loss factors will be defined in ComEd’s Rate RDS and proposed percentages range from 5.07% to 7.71% depending on customer class.</p>
        <h4>Changes in Transmission &amp; Distribution Losses</h4>
        <p>Any changes in Transmission or Distribution Losses due to tariff or rate changes through approved PJM/ComEd rate cases.</p>

        <h4>Reliability</h4>
        <p>Electric system reliability has two components--adequacy and security. Adequacy is the ability of the electric system to supply to aggregate electrical demand and energy requirements of the customers at all times, taking into account scheduled and unscheduled outages of system facilities. Security is the ability of the electric system to withstand sudden disturbances, such as electric short circuits or unanticipated loss of system facilities. The degree of reliability may be measured by the frequency, duration, and magnitude of adverse effects on consumer services.</p>

Some (such as geothermal and biomass) may be stock-limited in that stocks are depleted by use, but on a time scale of decades, or perhaps centuries, they can probably be replenished. Renewable energy resources include biomass, hydro, geothermal, solar and wind. In the future, they could also include the use of ocean thermal, wave, and tidal action technologies. Utility renewable resource applications include bulk electricity generation, on-site electricity generation, distributed electricity generation, non-grid-connected generation, and demand-reduction (energy efficiency) technologies.</p>
        <h4>Reregulation</h4>
        <p>The design and implementation of regulatory practices to be applied to the remaining regulated entities after restructuring of the vertically-integrated electric utility. The remaining regulated entities would be those that continue to exhibit characteristics of a natural monopoly, where imperfections in the market prevent the realization of more competitive results, and where, in light of other policy considerations, competitive results are unsatisfactory in one or more respects. Regulation could employ the same or different regulatory practices as those used before restructuring.</p>

        <h4>Securitize</h4>
        <p>The aggregation of contracts for the purchase of the power output from various energy projects into one pool which then offers shares for sale in the investment market. This strategy diversifies project risks from what they would be if each project were financed individually, thereby reducing the cost of financing. Fannie Mae performs such a function in the home mortgage market.</p>
